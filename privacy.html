    <h2>Firebase Service Data Setting</h2>
    <p>Firebase may collect technical data (e.g., IP addresses, API calls, usage logs) during service operations. This data is known as <strong>Firebase Service Data</strong> and is separate from user-provided content.</p>
    <p>By default, Google may use this data to enhance other Google services. If you choose to disable this option in the Firebase Console, the data will only be used to improve Firebase services directly.</p>
